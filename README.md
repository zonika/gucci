# Net-a-Porter x Gucci campaign homepage background

I thought it looked cute so I took it. N-A-P is using an iFrame on their homepage to display the html canvas with the flowers/birds and their accompanying animations, take that as you will.

See [Net-a-Porter](https://www.net-a-porter.com/) for it live idk. (UPDATE 5/12: this feature is no longer live. It can now be found on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160508032219/https://www.net-a-porter.com/))

# Preview

I wanted to put a live preview on codepen but I don't have a premium account and codepen is smart enough to block iFrames with outside sources and only premium accounts can upload assets so I'll leave you with this shitty gif I made of the page live.

# To run

Because of the createjs loader that's getting the json file, the page won't work if you open index.html from your local file system. So set up a local server.

Assuming you have python installed:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then just go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser of choice.
