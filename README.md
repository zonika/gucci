# Net-a-Porter x Gucci campaign homepage background

I thought it looked cute so I took it. N-A-P is using an iFrame on their homepage to display the html canvas with the flowers/birds, take that as you will.

See [https://www.net-a-porter.com/](Net-a-Porter) for it live idk.

Get that snake in there! (it's a video being displayed on another canvas element, shouldn't be too hard.)
